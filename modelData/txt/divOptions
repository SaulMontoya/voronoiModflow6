|  cell2d : [icell2d, xc, yc, ncvert, icvert]
|      * icell2d (integer) is the CELL2D number. Records in the CELL2D block
|        must be listed in consecutive order from the first to the last. This
|        argument is an index variable, which means that it should be treated
|        as zero-based when working with FloPy and Python. Flopy will
|        automatically subtract one when loading index variables and add one
|        when writing index variables.


|  vertices : [iv, xv, yv]
|      * iv (integer) is the vertex number. Records in the VERTICES block must
|        be listed in consecutive order from 1 to NVERT. This argument is an
|        index variable, which means that it should be treated as zero-based
|        when working with FloPy and Python. Flopy will automatically subtract
|        one when loading index variables and add one when writing index
|        variables.


|  nvert : integer
|      * nvert (integer) is the total number of (x, y) vertex pairs used to
|        characterize the horizontal configuration of the model grid.
